                                Actually, its already being used, but there are two things the current technology lacks:<br>
                                Its Un-standardized(has a very minute set for use): Therefore ~THE(our) OS~ <br>
                                It's not on the level(from lowest to highest systems) we are dealing with

                                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">Hypervisor</a><br>
                                        A Hypervisor Divides a single computing resource into multiple useable computers.
                                        Since we talking about OS-level development, bare-metal Hypervisor do exists.
                                        Our job is to figure out how to reverse it. If a single CPU can process tasks from multiple OSs, It must be possible for multiple CPUs(running the same OS) to process tasks coming through a `Network`
                                        Hypervisor divides, we need to unite
                                        To implement this, we would need to deep dive into how bare-metal Hypervisor divides its computing resources

                                        parallel processing is what this world has to offer has before we make our start
                                        ( we would probably use this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parallel_C )
                                        But Parallel Proc. has a lot of limited use cases and sometimes it even slows the program if implemented unnecessarily.
                                        We `may`, no, probably need to come up with our own Algorithm for better processing of data between different CPUs
